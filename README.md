# Neural_Networks
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help Beks create a binary classifier With the knowledge of machine learning and neural networks that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns
APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status
INCOME_AMT—Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

## Results
### Target Variable

The IS_SUCCESSFUL column is target variable in the model.

### Feature Variable

The APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, INCOME_AMT, and ASK_AMT columns are considered to be the features of the model.


### Neither Target Nor Features

The EIN, NAME, STATUS, and SPECIAL_CONSIDERATION columns are neither targets nor features and should be removed from the input data.

#### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

#### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

#### What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
